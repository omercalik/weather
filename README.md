# Weather App

A weather application which you can check daily info about weather. This application uses https://www.metaweather.com/api/ as data source.

Not every city is supported by the API. You can check available cities from [here.](https://www.metaweather.com/map/)

If you can't see the app that's because the CORS problem of the API. Try accessing the proxy server from https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo and then reload the page.
